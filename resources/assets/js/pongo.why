uploadOnSubmit:method ->Location 
	This function was put where it was because It doesnt load the right values when it is put in componentWillMount or ComponentDidMount... 
	Because at the time CWM and CDM are acive, some props would not have the right values.. Example: "this.props.allPictures" would be NULL at in CWM and CDM... so it only works when everything is ready in the render fxn
